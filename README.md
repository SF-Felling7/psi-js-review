# Birthdays on the Bus (Shoes 2.0)

We will have an array of objects that represents the class. The objects will contain a name and a boolean value that say if they have an April/Spring birthday. 

We will write a loop to count the number of birthdays on the bus (birthdays in April/Spring) and the number of non-spring birthdays. In addition we will log out Happy Birthday to the people who have April/Spring birthdays. 


We will build this without a function to start and then refactor it into a function.
